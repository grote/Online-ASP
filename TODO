1. i think there will be no anonymous variables
   to implement binder spilitting i will simply create new predicateliterals with their own domains
   if we have for example a predicate p(X,Y) where X is relevant and Y is irrelevant
   ill create a new predicate p(X) matching all p(X,_) thats easier and fits better into the current design
2. literals in the body could be ordered by some heuristic see reference in dlv paper
3. the method isFact has to get an additional parameter if aggregates shall be matched
4. write doxygen doc

OPTIONAL TODOS:
 - aggregates are always matched at the moment this could be improved
   (but this seems to not bother performance or program size)
   currently there is a negative dep added to a rule with an aggregate
   so every rule with aggregates belongs to a normal program
 - if a conflicting integrity constraint is found grounding could be stopped
