//! Constraint for Loop-Formulas
/*!
 * \ingroup constraint
 * Special purpose constraint for loop formulas of the form: R -> ~a1, ~a2, ..., ~an
 * where R is a conjunction (B1,...,Bm) of bodies that are false and a1...an are the atoms of
 * an unfounded set.
 * I.e. such a loop formula is equivalent to the following n clauses:
 * ~a1 v B1 v ... v Bm
 * ...
 * ~an v B1 v ... v Bm
 * Representing loop formulas as n clauses is wasteful because each clause
 * contains the same set of bodies. 
 * 
 * The idea behind LoopFormula is to treat the conjunction of atoms as a special
 * "macro-literal" L with the following properties:
 * - isTrue(L), iff for all ai isTrue(~ai) 
 * - isFalse(L), iff for some ai isFalse(~ai) 
 * - L is watchable, iff not isFalse(L)
 * - Watching L means watching all ai.
 * - setting L to true means setting all ai to false.
 * Using this convention the TWL-algo can be implemented as in a clause.
 * 
 * \par Implementation:
 * - The literal-array is divided into two parts, an "active clause" part and an atom part
 * - The "active clause" contains one atom and all bodies: [B1 ... Bj ~ai]
 * - The atom part contains all atoms: [~a1 ... ~an]
 * - Two of the literals of the "active clause" are watched (again: watching an atom means watching all atoms)
 * - If a watched atom becomes true, it is copied into the "active clause" and the TWL-algo starts.
