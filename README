Gringo 2.0.0

Gringo is a state of the art grounder and has many features that make writing
logic programs easy. Gringo 2.0.0 is an enhanced Version of its predesessor
gringo 1.0.0. It supports binder splitting, backjumping and all other features
already implemented in gringo 1.0.0. A broad set of potentialities for writing 
encodings for logic programs exists. Currently, no other grounder supports such
a rich featured language.

There are three different packages of gringo 2.0.0. 

1. Gringo
The ﬁrst version is gringo, it acts as a grounder and supports several output 
formats including a human readable format for debugging purposes. This version
can ground logic programs and output them to ﬁles or pipe them to a solver like
clasp or smodels.

2. Clingo
The second version is called clingo and is a grounder with the built-in solver
clasp. Output can directly be passed to the solver to compute answer sets
without the overhead of a pipe and an additional re-reading of the program.

3. Iclingo
The third package is called iclingo, which stands for "incremental clingo". In 
this version the grounder gringo can be used with clasp incrementally.

Detailed information can be found the in gringo documentation in the doc folder.
