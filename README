gringo is written in mostly Standard-C++ and was successfully built and run 
under Linux (x86-32, x86-64) using gcc and Windows (x86-32) using MinGW. 
Currently, it cannot be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio because it
uses some gnu extensions. Further notes can be found in the INSTALL file.

Known issues with Mac OS X 10.6
-------------------------------
clasp currently does not work when compiled with the pre-installed 
gcc (version 4.2.1). This affects clingo and iclingo builds because they
integerate with clasp. To workaround this problem, a 32-bit version will
be build on all darwin platforms.
