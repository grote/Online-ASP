There are two possibilities to build the project:
 1. Simply type make.
 2. Use cmake. There is a script called init.sh, which initializes two out-of-source builds. A new folder build with the subfolders debug and release is created. To build the debug/release versions change into the corresponding folders and type make. In theory cmake can also create kdevelop and visual studio project files, but i haven't testet that.
