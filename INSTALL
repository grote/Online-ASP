To build gringo the build system cmake is used. To build the lexers used by
gringo, the lexer-generator re2c is needed. The source code release contains
pregenerated paser and lexer files, so re2c is only needed if you checked out
a svn version. In case of trouble, there is always a set of pre-build versions
for different architectures available on:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/gringo_clingo_iclingo

The usual way to compile and install gringo should be:
make
cp build/gringo/release/bin/gringo <somewhere-in-your-path>

1 Compilation/Installation:
---------------------------
There is a Makefile simplifying the build process. This Makefile is 
capable of initializing out-of-source builds to build different versions of
gringo.

1.1 gringo:
-------------
make gringo_release
cp build/gringo/release/bin/gringo <somewhere-in-your-path>

1.2 clingo:
-------------
make clingo_release
cp build/clingo/release/bin/clingo <somewhere-in-your-path>

1.3 iclingo:
--------------
make iclingo_release
cp build/iclingo/release/bin/iclingo <somewhere-in-your-path>
