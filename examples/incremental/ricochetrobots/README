This bundle implements the board game "Ricochet Robots"
(in German: Rasende Roboter) by Alex Randolph.

More information is obtainable at

The encoding is tight and full of cardinality constraints, 
eg. lastime=2 gives Binary: 10.5% Ternary: 31.4% Other: 58.0%
With clasp, vmtf and vsids sometimes perform better than berkmin 
but this is no trend.

The bundle comes in several files:

- robots (the principal encoding, moving robots around)
- optrob (some easy but few optimizations - Ideas???)
- board16-1 (an authentic board description, comprising 16 queries)
  NOTE: many more are obtainable by changing the 4 card board pieces
- board5 (playing around :-)

Here's a typical call (after uncommenting a query in 'board16-1'):

gringo-2.0.0 --const lastime=11 robots optrob board16-1 | clasp-1.1.0 1
