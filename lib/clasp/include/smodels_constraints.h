//! Class implementing smodels-like cardinality- and weight constraints.
/*!
 * \ingroup constraint
 * This Constraint class represents the body of a smodels-like cardinality- 
 * resp. weight-constraint (i.e. only a lower bound is supported and weights must be
 * positive integers). A cardinality-constraint is handled like a weight-constraint where
 * all weights are equal to 1.
 *
 * The class implements the following four inference rules:
 * let sumWeights be the sum of the weights of all predecessors that are currently true.
 * let sumReach be the sum of the weights of all predecessors that are currently not false.
 * - FTB: If sumWeigts >= bound: set the body to true.
 * - BFB: If the body is false: set false all literals p for which sumWeights + weight(p) >= bound.
 * - FFB: If sumReach < bound: set the body to false.
 * - BTB: If the body is true: set true all literals p for which sumReach - weight(p) < bound.

//! Implements a (meta-)constraint for supporting Smodels-like minimize statements
/*!
 * \ingroup constraint
 * A solver contains at most one minimize constraint, but a minimize constraint
 * may represent several minimize statements. In that case, minimize statements added
 * earlier have higher priority. Note that this is inverse to the order used in lparse,
 * where the minimize statement written last has the highest priority. Otherwise, 
 * priority is handled like in smodels, i.e. statements
 * with lower priority become relevant only when all statements with higher priority
 * currently have an optimal assignment.
 *
 * MinimizeConstraint supports two notions of optimality: if mode is set to
 * compare_less solutions are considered optimal only if they are strictly smaller 
 * than previous solutions, otherwise, if mode is set to compare_less_equal a
 * solution is considered optimal if it is not greater than any previous solution.
 * Example: 
 *	m0: {a, b}
 *  m1: {c, d}
 *	Solutions: {a, c,...}, {a, d,...} {b, c,...}, {b, d,...} {a, b,...} 
 *	Optimal compare_less: {a, c, ...} (m0 = 1, m1 = 1}
 *  Optimal compare_less_equal: {a, c, ...}, {a, d,...}, {b, c,...}, {b, d,...}
